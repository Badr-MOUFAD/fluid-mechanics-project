# Overview
Part of a (mini) project in fluids mechanics, I studied together with my teammate **Zoubir MOUSTATIA** 
(@mzoubir01) the classical example of a flow around a cylinder. 

Our focus was mainly on characterizing the flow by the Reynolds number (Re), 
the drag and lift coefficient and Strouhal number.

We have made simulations to identify laminar and turbulent flows.
We have also made simulations of drag and lift coefficient both as a function of time and Re.
Finally, we were able to deduce the evolution of Strouhal number as a function of Re.

We have used `OpenFOAM` as solver to simulate the system, `Paraview` to visualize the output,
and `Python` to postprocess data.

The project article can be found here.



# About this repository
We have gathered in this repository the python code that was developed to postprocess data. 
As a brief description:

- We have implemented a class `ReadCoefficientsFromFile` that extract the useful information 
from the output file and then process it *(mean, Fourier transformation, dominant frequency, â€¦)*

- We have built a function `build_dict_simulations` that run over all the output files and 
thereby create a dictionary that gather all the simulations.

- The remaining python scripts are meant to create graphs and animations.

# Reproduce results
This repository is meant to guarantee the reproducibility of our findings. To do so follow the steps below:
1. Clone the repository
2. Download the simulation outputs from this link
3. Move the simulations to the folder `simulation_outputs`

After doing that, all the scripts must work without any problems


# Some beautiful animations
